NEWS: TPP

Version 1.0.0:
  
  o First release of the TPP package for analyzing Thermal Proteome Profiling 
    experiments.

Version 1.1.0:
  o Changes in devel will be characterized by version number 1.1.x

Version 1.1.1:

  o bugfixes in config table import from .csv files: 
    1. can now handle different types of delimitors (";", "\t", ",")
    2. automatically removes empty rows after import

Version 1.1.2:
  o the recent update of the gridExtra package to Version 2.0.0 required a small fix to 
    ensure sucessful plotting of the melting curves and parameter tables.

Version 1.1.3:
  o fixed problem in QC-plot generation due to the gridExtra package update: 
    adapted height parameter in grid.arrange

Version 1.1.4:
  o Curve parameters "a" and "b" are now reported in the output of analyzeTPPTR and tpptrCurveFit.

Version 1.2.5:
  o CCR-part: 
      fold changes can now be normalized to their lowest temperature during 
      import by the function tppccrNormalizeToReference. 
      This ensures that the transformed values will always be between 0 and 1.
      When normalizing to the lowest concentration, and this value is 0, a small 
      constant (1e-15) is added to prevent division by zero.
  o CCR-import:
      Argument nonZeroCols can be NULL if no additional filtering is needed.
  o CCR output: 
      To make filtering easier, the 'passed_filter' column now shows 
      FALSE even if proteins could not be used for fitting (instead of NAs).
  o CCR output: 
      To make filtering easier, the 'passed_filter' column now shows 
      FALSE even if proteins could not be used for fitting (instead of NAs).
  o CCR output: 
      column with normalization results was renamed from 'normalized' 
      to 'median_normalized' to distinguish from the newly introduced normalization 
      to value at lowest concentration.
  o Excel export: 
      Columns are only color-coded by experiment, when the number of
      experiments is > 1.
  o Excel export: 
      Columns are only color-coded by experiment when the number of
      experiments is > 1.
  o Excel export:
      Relative paths to the plots work now for TR- and CCR part
  o Bug fix for data import: 
      Unique identifiers now treated correctly again.
  o Bug fix for Excel output: 
      Boolean column entries are only transformed to  "yes"/"no" for non-missing values.
  o Bugfix in TR-QC plots: 
      do not attempt to create Tm difference histograms if only one experiment is provided.
  o Bugfix in TR normalization: 
      fixedReference argument works again
  o Bugfix in TR-QC plots: 
      do not attempt to plot minSlope vs. Tm-diffs if no valid Tm-diff values are available.

Version 2.1.0:
  o Major update to the CCR-part: It is now possible to fit and plot multiple
    experiments simultaneously.
  o It is now possible to perform user-specified comparisons of different 
    experiments. They are specified in the 'comparison' column of the config 
    table.
  o TR-part: Hypothesis testing is now separated from result table creation. Therefore, 
    a new function was introduced (tpptrAnalyzeMeltCurves) -> see vignette.
  o CCR-part: Curve fitting and plotting are now conducted by separate functions -> see
    vignette.
  o Bug fixes
  o Introduced color coding of the columns belonging to different experiments in 
    the excel output. This requires openxlsx version >= 2.4.0.
  o The CCR workflow now only returns normalized measurements if normalization was 
    actually performed. Unmodified measurements are always returned and indicated 
    by the suffix 'unmodified'.
  o Data import from tab-delimited files now ignores quotes so that protein annotation 
    fields can contain single ' or " characters.
  o Now enabling arbitrary numbers of plot colors for melting curves or dose response 
    curves.

Version 2.1.1:
Updated package vignette.
  
2.1.2:
  o Bugfix in config table import:
      All non-alphanumeric characters in the Experiment column are now replaced 
      by'_'.
 o Bugfix in QC scatter plots:
      Can now handle cases where protein IDs do not overlap between experiments,
      or where the temperatures differ between experiments. In this case, empty 
      plots are produced for the affectd experiment pair.
