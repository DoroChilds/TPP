#' @description Reference dataset obtained by TPP-TR experiments without drug
#' treatment on HepG2 cell lines. 
#' @details \code{tppRefData} is a list of data frames that contains
#'   TPP-TR measurements for a large number of proteins in wide format.
#'   The experiments were peroformed in two replicates. It can be used as a 
#'   reference for normalization of 2D-TPP data. See the vignette for the 2D
#'   workflow for details.
